# We have a list of integers X_1,X_2,â€¦,X_N. We would like them to be in strictly
# increasing order, but unfortunately, we cannot reorder them. This means that
# usual sorting algorithms will not work.
#
# Our only option is to change them by appending digits 0 through 9 to their right
# (in base 10). For example, if one of the integers is 10, you can turn it into
# 100 or 109 with a single append operation, or into 1034 with two operations (as
# seen in the image below).
#
# Given the current list, what is the minimum number of single digit append
# operations that are necessary for the list to be in strictly increasing order?
#
# For example, if the list is 100,7,10, we can use 4 total operations to make it
# into a sorted list, as the following image shows.
